            <p>I started my Modul 2 studies by reading the Responsive Web Design book. It complemented and deepened the
              classroom materials, explained the whys and the hows of the different approaches. I made plans and notes
              of this new knowledge,
              and set to work on the second project armed with these.

            <p>I won't go into much detail about the new project, as I didn't choose it in the end, but I'll mention
              that I wanted a modern, less childish topic. I also wanted something unique and special, so I could be
              excited about it.</p>
            <p>I was planning to create a web presence for a boutique shoemaker workshop, where an award winning
              shoemaker created bespoke shoes for business people, actors, performers… </p>
            <p>The shop handles repairs and reorders, maintains personal connection with its customers. Their main
              profile is hand-made, unique shoes; after personal measurement and consultation, customers can choose from
              a wide variety of materials,
              designs and patterns. But they can also bring their own ideas and request custom designs. The shoemaker
              develops her own designs and participates in shoemaker competitions with her creations.
            </p>
            <p>I was motivated by two Swiss and a Hungarian similar shops:
              <a class="inline" href="https://www.huwyler.com">Huwyler</a>,
              <a class="inline" href="https://www.redford.ch">Redford</a>,
              <a class="inline" href="http://attilacipo.hu">Attilacipő</a>
            </p>
            <p>I really like this idea and started to create sketches and a moodboard for the website. I bookmarked a
              few plans on behance, from which I planned to borrow colors, fonts and design elements.</p>
            <p>In the meantime I got busy with learning the new subject – JavaScript, and I put this project away for a
              while.

            <p>I started to read the “Eloquent JavaScript” book, which I find really good. 
              As the weeks passed and I began to understand and enjoy JavaScript, I started to work on some side projects. I further developed my homework “Coffee Machine”, practicing click events handling. You could unlock achievements and prizes during your “coffee break,” it was great fun! I also played around with the TODO list project. </p>
              <p> All this gave me the confidence that I will be able to write/plug in the little scripts which are needed for the functioning website and finish on time. But the project will take a significant amount of time, and I do have to make a decision. Will I work on the new project, which I'm excited about, but did not yet take a proper shape?

            <p>I felt that I got stuck in the planning phase with my new project and I'm going to run out of time. I decided at that point to briefly return to my previous webpage and try to refactor the static website in accordance with Modul 2 requirements. I felt that responsivity will not be a big challenge, and to practice the new material I rewrote the static website from Flex based to Grid base structure. Then created a few breakpoints/media queries where changes were necessary.</p>
            <p>That was for practicing, I haven't decided yet: should I choose the safer looking, but having its own potential pitfalls, route — work on the existing static (almost responsive) website. Making significant design and functionality changes without breaking it. I was aware of the dangers of refactoring a spaghetti codebase, but eventually I chose this route.
            </p>
            <p>In upgrading the original static website to responsive design I tried to preserve the original mood and appearance, but some modifications I deemed necessary. One of the main changes is that next to Montserrat and Pacifico I added a third typeface to the pages, which I use for navigation: Bebas Neue. This strong, pronounced font had to fit in with the rest of the design. It complements the black Montserrat subtitles, and the curves of Pacifico offset nicely the angular letters of Bebas Neue.</p>
            <p>To balance out the changes and to preserve the original “meditative” mood, corners of buttons and boxes got a 4px border radius, and to keep the flat style uniform the images lost their gray borders.</p> 
            <p>The white color got added to the new appearance. Otherwise, I kept the original colors after some hesitation about choosing a main color or replacing the warm background with white.

            <p>I wrote my own scripts for the dropdown menu, slider, accordion and tabs topics, then began to incorporate these into the otherwise ready website. The progress was slow, because I always found something to change or fix in my code or the website. It turned out that I need to somewhat restructure my html files. There was a moment when it looked impenetrable, but eventually I succeeded in refactoring my code without breaking it, and my javascript and jquery events came to live.</p>
            <p>For the dropdown navigation, my plans in January were to change the appearance of the (fixed to the top) navigation bar as the content is scrolled. Since it's not important that it's present in the same size when the user just browses the content as when they just arrive to the page, I wanted to shrink and fade it when the user scrolls down. Or it could even completely disappear, and could be brought back with a small scroll up. I saw inspiring examples for this.</p>
            <p>After all, I rejected these ideas, and implemented a side navigation bar for wide screens. On click, it brings out a full screen curtain navigation menu, with a slide animation. This side bar that brings out the navigation menu is always present, in desktop, tablet, and in mobile view, only its size changes, and in the smallest view it turns into a burger-menu. </p>
            <p>But I didn't give up on the scroll event either. I implemented a feature where the fullscreen background image fades away as you scroll down, so that the content can be visible. The image comes back if you scroll back to the top.</p>
            <p>For the slideshow element, I first implemented a very simple vanilla javascript slider with right-left stepping arrows and little circles for pagination. It has an unstoppable autoplay functionality, hopefully not annoying. I decided to keep this version until I can come up with a nicer slider one, just to move on with the requirements.</p>
            <p>In my first accordion the challenge was that I only wanted to use it in the mobile view. On wider screens I had three cards next to each other, which I wanted to put under one another and make them openable in mobile view. Eventually I was able to make it work without weird effects even if you resize the page.</p>
            <p>Since I learned how to do it, I decided to also have tabs. Fortunately, the site which has seven subpages had offered ample opportunity for that too.</p>
            <p>I left the form validation for last. As I was quite uncertain about the design for user feedback. Then my motto was keep it simple because I hate deadlines.

                <p>From September to October, I learned a lot about design. In addition to SAE lessons, I read books and searched the Internet for useful information and tutorial videos, and tried simple tasks. During this time I came across many interesting project ideas. It was not easy to pick one to try as an exam project.
                My first idea was to create a website for a restaurant, in the end I felt it was not close to my heart. I wanted to make a homepage for:</p>

                  <p>
                    - a vintage style interior decorator

                  <p>
                    - a downtown coffee shop with a coffee and a croissant logo

                    - a private kindergarten with a pet logo

                <p>My final choice was to blend the themes of meditation and childhood. My fictional project is a foundation that provides meditation classes for preschool and school children.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>15/11/19 Friday</h4>
                <p>I drew a couple of foxes just to see if I can.
                  I looked up kindergarten websites.
                  I read about meditation.
                </p>
                <h4>16/11/19 Saturday</h4>
                <p>I drew lots of foxes.
                  I searched for color schemes that fit to the topic.
                  I started making colored sketches on my iPad.</p>
                <h4>17/11/19 Sunday</h4>
                <p>I came up with a working plan. </p>
                <p>We have four weeks until Christmas:</p>
                <p>I:   Week #47: November  18 - 24          </p>
                <p>II.  Week #48: November 25 - December 1   </p>
                <p>III. Week #49: December  2 - 8            </p>
                <p>IV.  Week #50: December  9 - 15           </p>
                <p>After that I have to make preparations for Christmas.

                <h4>18/11/19 Monday</h4>
                <p>I drew a small fox in Adobe Illustrator too. 
                </p>
                <h4>19/11/19 Tuesday</h4>
                <p>I chose color swatches from colourlovers.com. I also looked for websites with fitting color schemes on awwwards.com. I tried to find pictures for the moodboard on behance.net.
                </p>
                <h4>20/11/19 Wednesday</h4>
                <p>I started with Adobe XD. I tried my best color schemes on a blank homepage with a navigation bar, a background and a footer. I decided that I want colored background bands with some faint pattern.
                </p>
                <h4>21/11/19 Thursday</h4>
                <p>I looked for fonts. Dancing Script with Roboto is my first choice. For now.</p>
                <p>I chose stock photos from pexels.com and pixabay.com.</p>
                <p>I read about meditation and studied homepages for kindergartens.</p>
                <p>I have created svg foxes from my sketches and I tried to use just their shadows as a background pattern.</p>
                <h4>22/11/19 Friday</h4>
                <p>My new fonts ideas are Patrick Hand Sc, Permanent Marker and Courgette.
                I like flat style homepages but for my project I might try some borders and shadows.
                </p>
                <h4>23/11/19 Saturday</h4>
                <p>I tried a lot of shadow and border variations. My foxes don't work well with my design. I have to restart this fox-logo-background-pattern plan again.</p>

                <h4>25/11/19 Monday</h4>
                <p>I tried to create logos for my homepage. My key words were: mindfulness relax fox children.</p>
                <h4>26/11/19 Tuesday</h4>
                <p>Logo design is difficult. I don't want a Buddha-like yoga figure or a lotus, nor a non-figurative fox head. But, maybe a sitting fox silhouette in a lotus or a simple taw-like ball with reflections.</p>
                <h4>27/11/19 Wednesday</h4>
                <p>I learned about html and layout choices.</p>
                <h4>28/11/19 Thursday</h4>
                <p>Today I understood float and flex positioning.</p>
                <h4>29/11/19 Friday</h4>
                <p>Today I understood a lot about css coding. I have a feeling now that I can do this.</p>
                <h4>30/11/19 Saturday</h4>
                <p>I coded up a landing page. It is just a beginning, but I wrote it, I understand it all, jay!</p>
                <h4>1/12/19 Sunday</h4>
                <p>Confusion. I have validator for code but not for design.

                <p>I watched a lot of InDesign tutorial videos and I practiced, but…</p>
                <p>Illustrator was more suitable for my workflow. If I had the whole document ready I could have created a well-designed pdf from it in InDesign. But as I am still working on my documentation file it is easier for me to work with it in Illustrator.</p>
